# TrainApplication
Train Application for HW7 UMN Bootcamp

The Train Application stores user input data on train schedules in a Firebase database. Train data is then collected from Firebase and displayed in the Current Train Schedule table. Moment.js is used to calculate Next Arrival and Minutes Away based on current time and the train data provided by the user. The table is set to reset every second, so Minutes Away will update with time.
